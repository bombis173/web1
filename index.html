  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>World Wide Web (WWW, W3) refers to a worldwide information space where people can share information through Internet-connected computers. It is often referred to simply as the Web. The term is often synonymous with the Internet, but strictly speaking, it is a different concept. The Web is just one service that works on the Internet, such as e-mail. Since 1993, however, the Web has taken an absolute place in the Internet's architecture.

It is also referred to as the transmission method of exchanging pictures and characters using HTTP protocol, hypertext, and HTML format on the Internet.
